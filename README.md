# Physics of Complex Networks Project
Two projects for the Master Degree course: "Physics of Complex Networks":
- task 34: "Game Theory on networks". Max score: 0.4.
- task 41: "Public transport in large cities worldwide". Max score: 1.2.

<sub>**Disclaimer**: the code written and used to complete these projects was fragmented in multiple MarkDown+R notebooks, to ease workflow and allow me to better explore data and to experiment different ideas. After producing the report, I unified the original notebooks into a standalone Rscript for each of the two tasks with the aid of Claude Opus 4.6, for easy reproducibility.</sub>
